<!-- Bugs -->

1. What if a faculty clicks on a link of other faculty's class and take attendance? Or a student sends data to a faculty route using postman?
2. If a student is not part of a class, can he still mark present in that?

<!-- Challenges -->

1. Student call their friend (already marked present) who tell the code and they enter the code quickly.

<!-- Possible Solutions -->

7. Stay logged in only at one place at a time
8. Can not login to another place for 5 days after logging in to one place

<!-- Doubts -->

1. what if we delete a student from a class but not from previous attendance records?

<!-- Optimizations -->

1. (Maybe) Date in a class is created when teacher clicks start generating - not when a student is present
2. Replace select with dropdown
